### Joystick Test

```bash
$ sudo bash
$ rosrun ps3joy ps3joy.py

//安装jstest-gtk后，可以进行摇杆测试
$ jstest-gtk
```

### Configuring  Joystick with PS3

http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick

#### Installing

Start by installing the package:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joy
```

#### Configuring the Joystick

Connect your joystick to your computer. Now let's see if Linux recognized your joystick.

```bash
$ ls /dev/input/
```

You will see a listing of all of your input devices similar to below:

```
by-id    event0  event2  event4  event6  event8  mouse0  mouse2  uinput
by-path  ...  js0  js1
```

As you can see above, the joystick devices are referred to by jsX ; in this case, our **PS3 joystick** is j<u>s0 (IMU part) and js1 (buttons & axes part)</u>. Let's make sure that the joystick is working.

```bash
$ sudo jstest /dev/input/js1
$ sudo jstest /dev/input/js1
```

You will see the output of the joystick on the screen. Move the joystick around to see the data change.

Now let's make the joystick accessible for the ROS joy node (because we're going to get the axes and buttons' info). Start by listing the permissions of the joystick:

```
$ ls -l /dev/input/js1
```

You will see something similar to:

```
crw-rw-XX- 1 root dialout 188, 0 2009-08-14 12:04 /dev/input/js1
```

If XX is rw: the js device is configured properly.

If XX is --: the js device is not configured properly and you need to:

```
$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/input/js1
```

#### Starting the Joy Node

To get the joystick data published over ROS we need to start the joy node. First let's tell the joy node which joystick device to use- the default is js0.

**Do not put quotes around the device name!!!**

```
$ roscore
$ rosparam set joy_node/dev /dev/input/js1
```

Now we can start the joy node.

```bash
$ rosrun joy joy_node
```

As you move the joystick around, you will see something similar to :

```
---
axes: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
buttons: (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
---
axes: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.12372203916311264)
buttons: (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

On kinetic the new [sensor_msgs/Joy](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Joy.html) message is emitted, which includes a [Header](http://wiki.ros.org/msg#headerSect):

```

  seq: 9414

buttons: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
